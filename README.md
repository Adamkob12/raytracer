# Ray-Tracer from scratch
## You can add to the scene as many primitives as you'd like, and give them the following properties: reflectiveness, shininess, color, size, position
## You can add to the scene all sorts of different lights: Ambient light, Directional light, Point light, and modify they're properties
## You can also change the resolution, the position and orientation of of the camera, the rendering technique and more!
